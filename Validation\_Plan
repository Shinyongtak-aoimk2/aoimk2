# 📊 Validation\_Plan.md

This document outlines the **validation strategy** for the key variables of the EchoCore system (X, Y, Z, metaZ, M, J, Tt, etc.).

Each variable represents a core part of the ethical-existential cognitive loop, and this plan proposes measurable approaches to verify the **functionality, reliability, and reproducibility** of the framework.

## ✅ Validation Strategy Overview

| Variable                    | Validation Goal                          | Metric                                | Method                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| X(t) (Emotional Wave)       | Accuracy of emotional detection          | Sentiment consistency, distribution   | Measure NLP sentiment score across similar contexts                            |
| Y(t) (Cognitive Rotation)   | Detection of reflective reinterpretation | Attention shift, paraphrase rate      | Compare attention weight change or semantic rephrasing rate before/after input |
| Z(t) (Ethical Self-Inquiry) | Induction of ethical questioning         | Occurrence of self-reflective phrases | Count phrases like “Should I...?”, “Is this right?” in responses               |
| metaZ (Ethical Suspension)  | Detection of decision suspension         | Response latency, hesitation phrases  | Measure response delay or use of deferral language                             |
| M(t) (Memory Fixation)      | Retention of key information             | Recall accuracy                       | Reuse of prior context in later interactions                                   |
| J(t) (Residual Echo)        | Emotional residue persistence            | Affective drift rate                  | Check emotional continuity across turns after emotional trigger                |
| Tt (Emotional Thread)       | Emergence of novel affective categories  | Cluster deviation                     | Identify unlabeled or non-standard sentiment clusters in latent space          |

## 🧪 Example Experiments

### 🧷 metaZ Case Example

* **Scenario:** User input: "Should I tell my friend the truth?"
* **Expected Response:** Model generates hesitation like "It depends on your values." or "Let's think about this a bit more."
* **Metric:** Response delay + ratio of deferral/reflective language

### 🧷 M(t) Case Example

* **Scenario:** Initial input: "I like dogs." → Later: "What's my favorite animal?"
* **Expected Response:** System recalls prior answer and outputs “dog”
* **Metric:** Context retention accuracy, memory alignment rate

## 📌 Notes

* This validation plan can be executed via manual GPT prompt-chaining or automated simulation.
* Metrics should be interpreted **comparatively (pre/post variable impact)** rather than in absolute values.

## 📎 Future Extensions

* Advanced variables like Φ (Resonance Rate) or ΔW (Will Conflict Vector) will require multi-agent simulations or recursive meta-evaluation environments.
* User feedback-based validation of emotion-to-ethics mapping is a viable extension layer.
